        <p><h3>Italian Eggs & Sausage</h3></p>

        <img src="../images/eggs_sausage.jpg" alt="Italian baked eggs & sausage" height="250" width="230">

        <p>This isn't your typical egg bake! I serve this robust casserole of eggs, Italian sausage and fire-roasted tomatoes in bowls with warm, crusty rolls spread with butter.</p>

        <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>

        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>1 pound bulk Italian sausage</li>
                <li>1 jar (24 ounces) fire-roasted tomato and garlic pasta sauce</li>
                <li>1 can (14-1/2 ounces) fire-roasted diced tomatoes, drained</li>
                <li>3/4 cup part-skim ricotta cheese</li>
                <li>8 large eggs</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
                <li>1/4 cup shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh basil</li>
                <li>1 French bread demi-baguette (4 ounces), cut into 1-inch slices</li>
                <li>1/4 cup butter, softened</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p><h3>Directions</h3></p>

        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350Â°. In a large skillet over medium heat, cook sausage, crumbling meat, until no longer pink, 3-4 minutes; drain. Stir in pasta sauce and tomatoes. Transfer to a 13x9-in. baking dish.</li>
                <li>Dollop ricotta cheese on top of meat mixture. Gently break an egg into a small bowl; slip egg onto meat mixture between dollops of ricotta. Repeat with remaining eggs. Sprinkle with salt, pepper and Parmesan cheese.</li>
                <li>Bake until egg whites are completely set and yolks have begun to thicken but are not hard, 30-35 minutes. Remove from oven; sprinkle with basil.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, spread bread slices with butter; place on an ungreased baking sheet. Preheat broiler. Broil 3-4 in. from heat until golden brown, 1-2 minutes on each side. Serve immediately with baked eggs.</li>
            </ol>
